Building ruby-opengl
====================


Pre-requisites
--------------

On Ubuntu, aside from Ruby and the Rake gem, you'll need the following
packages:

* `libgl1-mesa libgl1-mesa-dri libglu1-mesa freeglut3`
* `libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev`

On OS X, you will need to install your own version of Ruby as the
version that ships with OS X has known problems with properly building
ruby-opengl bindings.  You'll also need XCode for gcc and tools.

Manual Build instructions
------------------

1. Install mkrf (Need at least version 0.2.0)
   
   gem install -y mkrf
2. Run 'rake' at the top level of the project
3. Run 'rake gem' to build a gem
4. Run 'gem install pkg/ruby-opengl-<version>.gem' to install the gem


Installing from rubygems
-------------------

ruby-opengl should also support being installed via gems now.  Just
try 'gem install -y ruby-opengl' and it should pull down the gem
and try to build the bindings for you automatically.


Testing / Running
-----------------

To run a sample file:

    $ cd examples
    $ ruby plane.rb

Hit ESC to exit.
