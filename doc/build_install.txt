Building ruby-opengl
====================


Pre-requisites
--------------

On Ubuntu, aside from Ruby and the Rake gem, you'll need the following
packages:

* `libgl1-mesa libgl1-mesa-dri libglu1-mesa freeglut3`
* `libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev`


Build instructions
------------------

The current build setup is still under construction. When last looked at
(late November 2006), we were waiting for
the next mkrf release (we've patched what they have in svn, so it works,
but their maintainer seems to have moved on and not made a release
containing our fix). Building our ruby-opengl works, but you'll need
the version of mkrf still in svn.

Once you have a mkrf in place, on unixy platforms, just run

    ./build.sh

to build.

After building, the extension modules are automatically copied to the
project's `./lib` directory.


Installing
----------

For now, if you want to install ruby-opengl on your system, you can
do so manually (there is no gem, nor even a release, for it yet).
Just copy the contents of `./lib` into your
`.../lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8` directory (or anywhere else `ruby`
searches for modules).


Testing / Running
-----------------

To run a sample file:

    $ cd examples
    $ ruby plane.rb

Hit ESC to exit.
