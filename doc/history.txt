Project history
===============

The [original ruby-opengl](http://www2.giganet.net/~yoshi/) was written
by Yoshi.

James A. desperately wanted to get the OpenGL Ruby bindings working on his Mac,
but they wouldn't even compile on OSX. After a little bit of tweaking, he made
his patched bindings available to the ruby community in a very informal manner.

John G. then wanted to clean it up and add some docs to it, and so started
tweaking and put up a new site and made his changes available.

Then Peter M. came along and decided to try updating ruby-opengl using SWIG,
as it seemed easier than doing everything by hand. Peter wrote the new code,
John started the actual RubyForge project, put up a new site, and Peter
committed the code.

Thu M. V. joined the project with a lot of energy, and the mailing list
was showing a good bit of activity.

After some experience, we began to question whether SWIG was necessary/helpful
for a project of this nature.  The leaning was that people want to abandon
SWIG and go back to maintaining the binding files by hand. Thu even provided
a script to help with the manual coding that would be required without using
SWIG.

The reasoning at the time was:

Pro-SWIG:

* Could use the .i files for another project, perhaps (OTOH, we couldn't
  use previous .i files on this project...)

* It's supposed to require less manual coding.

Con-SWIG:

* yet another tool to learn

* OpenGL isn't really all that big

* OpenGL doesn't change a lot

* A lot of boilerplate and overhead in the generated files because SWIG is
  a general tool.


In September 2006, we stopped using SWIG. Thu and Peter began fine tuning
Thu's original `utils/mkwrap.rb` script.

Development stalled in October 2006.

Development picked up again towards the end of 2006. After a long hiatus 
and getting a new release of mkrf out the door.  ruby-opengl is proud
to put out version 0.33.0 as a gem for everyone to try out.
