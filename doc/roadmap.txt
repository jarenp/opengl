Roadmap
=======

* Ensure support for 2.0 and 2.1 is solid 
* Update and cleanup GLU
* Update and cleanup GLUT
* Add RDoc documentation comments to C API
* Create more example code
* Write a getting started tutorial
* Write documentation on things that are different from C API
* Add support for pixel pack/unpack buffer (2.1 functionality)
* Account for alignment in size check when sending data in GL_BITMAP mode
  (functions glTexImage* and other)

Possible Features
========
* Possibly port GLU to use Ruby/DL
