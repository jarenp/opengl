ruby-opengl
===========

[ruby-opengl][] consists of Ruby extension modules that are bindings for
the [OpenGL][], GLU, and [GLUT][] libraries. They are currently being
generated with the help of [SWIG][]. ruby-opengl is:

* still very experimental at this point,
* may possibly be intended to be a replacement for [Yoshi's ruby-opengl][],
  and
* may possibly be a continuation of the now halted recent project of the
  same name ([halted ruby-opengl][]).

It's licensed under the MIT license. Please see the included MIT-LICENSE
file for the terms of the license.

Status: Pre-Alpha
-----------------

As for the status of what we're currently experimenting on:

* Compiles and runs on Mac OS X.
* Compiles on GNU/Linux, but doesn't run (yet).
* Very few of the OpenGL calls have been excercised, let alone tested. I
  expect that many of them will run fine.
* Several of the convenience wrapper functions that Yoshi wrote
  that have not yet been ported.
* No thought has been directed toward performance.


Code layout
-----------

The directory structure is:

* `docs/` -- Contains documentation for the project.
* `ext/` -- Contains the SWIG files, build files and other miscellaneous
  files needed to compile the ruby extensions for OpenGL and GLUT.
* `lib/` -- Ruby files that provide glue code to run programs written in
  the naming style of Yoshi's code.
* `test/` -- Contains sample ruby files that make OpenGL and GLUT calls.
  No real tests so far.


TODO
----

* Make the rake build hierarchical
* Rename "ext" to "swig", and only put the built extensions in ext
  (separate the build env from the build products)
* Add the ESC keyboard handler to smooth.rb
