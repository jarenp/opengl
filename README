= ruby-opengl

ruby-opengl[http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-opengl/] is a Ruby extension
for the OpenGL, GLU and GLUT libraries using SWIG.

It is licensed under the MIT license. Please see the included MIT-LICENSE
file for the terms of the license.

== Status: Pre-Alpha

Currently, ruby-opengl:
* Compiles and runs on Mac OS X.
* Compiles on Linux, but doesn't run (yet)
* Very few of the opengl calls have been excercised, let alone tested.  I
  expect that many of them will run fine.
* There are several of the convenience wrapper functions that Yoshi wrote
  that have not yet been ported.
* No thought has been directed toward performance.

== Layout

The directory structure is:

    docs/
        Contains documentation for the project.
    ext/
        Contains the SWIG files, build files and other miscellaneous files
        needed to compile the ruby extensions for OpenGL and GLUT.
    lib/
        Ruby files that provide glue code to run programs written in the
        naming style of Yoshi's code.
    test/
        Contains sample ruby files that make OpenGL and GLUT calls.  No
        real tests so far.

== Building ruby-opengl

=== Pre-requisites

SWIG[http://www.swig.org/] must be installed on the build machine.  I'm
using the fink version of swig on my mac:

  $ swig -version

  SWIG Version 1.3.20
  Copyright (c) 1995-1998
  University of Utah and the Regents of the University of California
  Copyright (c) 1998-2003
  University of Chicago
  Compiled with g++-3.3 [powerpc-apple-darwin8.3.0]

  Please see http://www.swig.org for reporting bugs and further information

=== Build on Mac OS X

The current build is still not great.
* Need to make the rake build hierarchical, in a rake-like manner.
* Need to remove duplication in the rakefiles.
* Haven't tested on any platform besides Mac OS X.

To build, just run <tt>rake</tt> at the top level.  This will do everything
necessary to build both the OpenGL and GLUT bindings for ruby.  The top
level +rakefile+ calls down to <tt>ext/gl/rakefile</tt> and
<tt>ext/glut/rakefile</tt> to do the real work.

=== Testing / Running

To run a sample file:
  $ cd test
  $ ruby plane.rb

Just hit <tt>ESC</tt> to exit the super-interesting OpenGL program.

== Roadmap

Most people want to just download an OpenGL binding, install, and be done
with it.  The plan is to deliver OS/Arch specific gems with the extensions
pre-compiled and everything ready to go.  We aren't there yet.

In the meantime, you have to install a few tools, compile and install the
extension, before it will work.

== TODO

* Make the rake build hierarchical
* Rename "ext" to "swig", and only put the built extensions in ext
  (separate the build env from the build products)
* Get the documentation going
* Add the ESC keyboard handler to smooth.rb
