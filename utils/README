The utils directory
-------------------

Some of the files in here are just temporary. This directory
is a bit of a catch-all at the moment.

### Directory contents ###

* For generating website html
    * `mkdn2html.rb` -- for converting the .txt files to html.
    * `post-mkdn2html.rb` -- for the html syntax highlighting.

* Tools planned for auto-generating the modules.
    * `missing.rb` -- try to show what's missing from our module(s)
    * `mkwrap.rb` -- trying to generate our module code.
    * `mkwrap_test.rb` -- starting attempt to test `mkwrap.rb`
    * `mkwrap-gl.rb` -- first try at generating the gl code
      (instead of glut, which mkwrap.gl attempts).
    * `glut_test.rb` -- seems to be for testing the generated
      `glut.c` file (that we may produce).

* Other random stuff lying around:
    * `mac_gl_missing`, `mac_glut_missing` -- functions we
      seem to be missing that are in the Mac OpenGL impl
      (note, we're using Mesa as our reference implementation)
    * `test.h` -- used for testing `mkwrap.rb` on.
