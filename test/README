ruby-opengl tests
=================

This directory contains the unit tests for ruby-opengl.  You should be able
to run the tests directly:

    ruby -rubygems tc_include_gl.rb

You can also run all the tests by using the runtests.sh

    ./runtests.sh

Note the tests are currently a work in progress.  For tc_gl_vertex.rb you
will need to press ESC to close each window as it runs through the tests

TODO
=====
o Add require 'opengl' so tc_opengl_namespace.rb will pass
o Setup a rake task to run the tests so from $RUBY_OPENGL_HOME
  Example:
    rake test                      # to run all tests
    rake test TEST=tc_gl_vertex.rb # Run just one test
