Status: 0.33.0 Released!
-----------------

Current status:

* Support for OpenGL 2.0 and 2.1 in trunk
* Initial build support for Windows in trunk
* Compiles and runs on GNU/Linux (with Mesa) and Mac OS X.
* First gem release finally available.  Run 'gem install -y ruby-opengl' to try
  it out
* You must require 'gl' before using 'glu'
* REQUIRES mkrf 0.2.0 or higher to build and install properly
* To compile under Mac OS X you MUST install your own version of Ruby
  as the version included with Tiger (1.8.2) has a broken rbconfig
  and will fail to build the project properly.  Try either DarwinPorts,
  fink, or building your own from source.
* New project maintainer
