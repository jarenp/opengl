Experimental modules
--------------------

This directory is intended to contain a few pure Ruby modules that
act to make ruby-opengl behave in more "Rubyish" ways. The plan is
to add some files to this directory that seem promising, then keep
them here to stew for a while, giving folks a chance to decide how
useful they are, and whether or not they belong in ruby-opengl
proper.

The experimental modules in here that we're currently looking at
are:
