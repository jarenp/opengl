Roadmap
=======

This is a pre-alpha project, and we're still currently experimenting
with a number of different ideas and plans.

Possible current plan
---------------------

Most people want to just download an OpenGL binding, install, and be done
with it.  We may deliver OS/Arch specific gems with the extensions
pre-compiled and everything ready to go.  We aren't there yet.

In the meantime, you have to install a few tools, compile and install the
extension, before it will work.


Another possible current plan
-----------------------------

After some more experimentation, we may scrap the idea of using
SWIG and go back to developing
[ruby-opengl 0.34pre2](http://www.simisen.com/cgi-bin/jmg/ruby-opengl.rb).


Yet another possible current plan
---------------------------------

We're looking seriously at maybe using
[rubygl](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygl/) instead. rubygl has a
number of very nice "rubyish" features. Although they make it less like
the C API with which everyone is already familiar, they add that special
Ruby magic. :)
