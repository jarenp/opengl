Building ruby-opengl
====================


Pre-requisites
--------------

On Ubuntu, aside from Ruby and the Rake gem, you'll need the following
packages:

* `libgl1-mesa libgl1-mesa-dri libglu1-mesa freeglut3`
* `libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev`



Build instructions
------------------

The current build is still not great and will be undergoing some
changes.

For now, to build, just run `rake` at the top level.  This will do
everything necessary to build the OpenGL and GLUT bindings for
Ruby.  The top level `rakefile` calls down to `ext/gl/rakefile` and
`ext/glut/rakefile` to do the real work.


Testing / Running
-----------------

To run a sample file:

    $ cd test
    $ ruby plane.rb

Just hit ESC to exit the super-interesting OpenGL program.
