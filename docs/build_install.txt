Building ruby-opengl
====================


Pre-requisites
--------------

SWIG must be installed on the build machine. I'm using the fink version
of swig on my mac:

    $ swig -version

    SWIG Version 1.3.20
    Copyright (c) 1995-1998
    University of Utah and the Regents of the University of California
    Copyright (c) 1998-2003
    University of Chicago
    Compiled with g++-3.3 [powerpc-apple-darwin8.3.0]

On Ubuntu, aside from Ruby and the Rake gem, you'll need the following
packages:

* `swig` (you might also want `swig-doc swig-examples` too)
* `libgl1-mesa libgl1-mesa-dri libglu1-mesa freeglut3`
* `libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev`


Please see <http://www.swig.org> for reporting bugs and further information
about SWIG.


Build instructions
------------------

The current build is still not great. Some TODO's:

* Need to make the rake build hierarchical, in a rake-like manner.
* Need to remove duplication in the rakefiles.
* Haven't tested on any platform besides Mac OS X.

To build, just run `rake` at the top level.  This will do everything
necessary to build both the OpenGL and GLUT bindings for ruby.  The top
level `rakefile` calls down to `ext/gl/rakefile` and
`ext/glut/rakefile` to do the real work.


Testing / Running
-----------------

To run a sample file:

    $ cd test
    $ ruby plane.rb

Just hit ESC to exit the super-interesting OpenGL program.
