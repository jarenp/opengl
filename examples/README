Examples
========

Just some quick notes on which examples work and which don't.


Running legacy ruby-opengl code
-------------------------------

Note that the filenames ending with `_prev.rb` contain code that is compatible
with the previous version of ruby-opengl (i.e. Yoshi's version). If you have
code that runs with the previous version, to make it run with this current
version, either see the tutorial about the simple changes you can make to the
code, or else just use

    require "gl_prev"
    require "glu_prev"
    require "glut_prev"

at the top of your files instead of 

    require 'opengl'
    require 'glut'

For examples of using the legacy code look at the directory legacy/ for
lots of example code that was borrowed from Yoshi's examples
