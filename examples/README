Examples
========

Just some quick notes on which examples work and which don't.


Running legacy ruby-opengl code
-------------------------------

Note that the filenames ending with `_prev.rb` contain code that is compatible
with the previous version of ruby-opengl (i.e. Yoshi's version). If you have
code that runs with the previous version, to make it run with this current
version, either see the tutorial about the simple changes you can make to the
code, or else just use

    require "gl_prev"
    require "glu_prev"
    require "glut_prev"

at the top of your files instead of 

    require 'opengl'
    require 'glut'

(Of course, if you haven't yet installed ruby-opengl on your system, you'll
need to include paths in those require statments above: as in,
`require "../lib/gl_prev"`.)


Status of examples
------------------

* plane.rb -- works
* smooth.rb, smooth_prev.rb -- works
